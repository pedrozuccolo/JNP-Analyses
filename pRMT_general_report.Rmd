Maio 2022: fiz acordo com a The Hyve que inclu√≠a 

"Hi Pedro, I just spoke to Nivethika. I think we have a plan. We'd definitely like to support you setting up RADAR-base -- part of our goal is trying to get others to take up use of the platform, we have a small pot of person-hours available for pro bono work. I think as you are already well underway to getting setup this would be a good case for us to give you some final support to get to a starting point for your project.
I think Nivethika has suggested getting setup on K3S on AWS?
In return, we would ask that Hyve https://www.thehyve.nl/ and King's College Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre are acknowledged on academic output https://maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/acknowledging-the-brc/. Also we might ask that you perhaps would be willing to write a short blog post on the work on the https://radar-base.org website?"
